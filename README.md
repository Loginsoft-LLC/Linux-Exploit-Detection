# Linux-Exploit-Detection
Linux-based vulnerabilities (CVE) exploit detection through runtime security using Falco/Osquery/Yara/Rego/Sigma

This is an experimental project to evaluate possible ways to detect exploits (CVE) in a Linux environment (HOST/Container/Cloud) using 
 - `ebpf` based - Falco Runtime Security
 - Analytic + Memory based - Osquery + Yara
 - Policy based - Rego + OPA/Tracee
 - Log based - Sigma
 
We were able to detect the majority of the exploits through `ebpf` or `kprobe` instrumentation by analyzing the syscalls. Both `Falco` and `Rego` approaches worked accurately in Host & Containerized environments. However, there are a few limitations in all of the above approaches, stay tuned - the blog coming out soon.

More to come...

All of these detections were tested in a host & containerized environment where reproduced the exploit and captured required events. The rules in the repository can lead to performance overhead, we would suggest testing it before using it in a production environment.
