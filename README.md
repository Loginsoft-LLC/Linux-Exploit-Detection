# Linux-Exploit-Detection
Linux-based vulnerabilities (CVE) exploit detection through runtime security using Falco/Osquery/Yara/Rego/Sigma

This is an experimental project to evaluate possible ways to detect exploits (CVE) in a Linux environment (HOST/Container/Cloud) using 
 - [`ebpf`](https://ebpf.io/) based - [Falco Runtime Security](https://falco.org/)
 - Analytic + Memory based - [Osquery](https://www.osquery.io/) + [Yara](http://virustotal.github.io/yara/)
 - Policy based - [Rego + OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/)/ [Aquasec-Tracee](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee)
 - Log based - [Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)
 
We were able to detect the majority of the exploits through `ebpf` or `kprobe` instrumentation by analyzing the syscalls. Both `Falco` and `Rego` approaches worked accurately in Host & Containerized environments. However, there are a few limitations in all of the above approaches, stay tuned - the blog coming out soon.

More to come...

All of these detections were tested in a host & containerized environment where reproduced the exploit and captured required events. The rules in the repository can lead to performance overhead, we would suggest testing it before using it in a production environment.
